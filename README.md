# Visualizing FEMA National Risk Index Data

## Purpose
This repository contains data visualization work for EDS 240 (Data Visualization & Communication) at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School. The project explores patterns in natural hazard risk across US counties, with specific focus on comparing California counties to other states.

**HW #3** (upcoming): Integration of American Community Survey (ACS) demographic data

## Data Access
Data for this project comes from the [FEMA Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool (RAPT)](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map). 

To replicate this analysis:
1. Navigate to RAPT → click NRI button → find National Risk Index Counties layer
2. Click the three dots → Export to CSV
3. Place the downloaded file in the `data/` directory (not tracked by git)

Alternatively, access the dataset via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your-link-here) (if provided by instructor).
